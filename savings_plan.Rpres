The Idea
========================================================

Create a small application including a GUI, that calculates and visualizes the results (including final balance) of a monthly savings plan.

The user can choose:
- monthly amount to invest
- duration (in years)
- yearly returns in percent (interest, dividents, gains,...)
- day on which the money is invested



Simple Example
========================================================
30 years, 100 Euro, 1st of each month, annual return of 6 %:

```{r code}
paid <- 1200 # 12*100 Euro
oneYear <- 1200 + 6.5 * 6 * 100 / 100
totalBalance <- oneYear
savingsDF <- data.frame(year = 1, ammountPaid = paid, totalBalance = totalBalance )
for(i in 2:30){
  paid <- paid + 1200
  totalBalance <- totalBalance * (1 + 6/100) + oneYear
  savingsDF[i,] <- c(i, paid, totalBalance) }
head(savingsDF,2) # show first 2 entries
```

The Result
========================================================

```{r plot, fig.width=19}
r <- barplot(savingsDF$totalBalance/1000, names.arg = savingsDF$year, main = "Total Balance in 1000 â‚¬", 
             xlab = "Years", ylim = c(0, totalBalance/800), col = "blue")
    lines(r, savingsDF$ammountPaid/1000, type = "h", col = "red", lwd = 4)
```

Try it!
